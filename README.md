# 🏠 Programming for Data Analytics — Manchester Housing EDA
# 📊 Project Overview

This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a Manchester housing dataset using Python. The analysis focuses on data preprocessing, datatype correction, missing value handling, and statistical exploration of housing characteristics that influence property prices.

The notebook demonstrates how raw housing data can be transformed into meaningful insights through structured data cleaning, visualization, and statistical investigation.

This work was completed as part of the Programming for Data Analytics (COM7024) module.

# 🗂 Dataset

The dataset contains housing information including:

💰 Price

🌊 Waterfront property indicator

📏 Floor space measurements

🏗 Year built

🏡 Other structural housing attributes

The dataset required preprocessing before analysis, including datatype correction and handling missing values.

# 🎯 Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

Import and inspect a real-world dataset using Python

Correct incorrect data types

Handle missing values appropriately

Compare dataset statistics before and after preprocessing

Perform focused exploratory analysis on key variables

Visualize relationships between housing features and price

# 🛠 Tools and Libraries

The project was implemented using:

🐍 Python

📓 Jupyter Notebook

🐼 Pandas

🔢 NumPy

📈 Matplotlib

📊 SciPy

# 🔍 Analysis Performed
# 🧹 Data Cleaning

Datatype validation and correction

Missing value imputation using median values

Dataset consistency checks

# 📉 Exploratory Analysis

Waterfront property price comparison

Floor space distribution analysis

Relationship between build year and price

Summary statistics before and after preprocessing

# 📊 Visualization

The project includes visualizations such as:

Histograms
